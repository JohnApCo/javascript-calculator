## About The Project

<p>This calculator app will be a great test of your CSS and JS skills especially. If you're wanting to practice using Grid, this challenge will be perfect for you!
The challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### Users should be able to:

<p><strong>User Story #1:</strong> My calculator should contain a clickable element containing an <code>=</code> (equal sign) with a corresponding <code>id="equals"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #2:</strong> My calculator should contain 10 clickable elements containing one number each from 0-9, with the following corresponding IDs: <code>id="zero"</code>, <code>id="one"</code>, <code>id="two"</code>, <code>id="three"</code>, <code>id="four"</code>, <code>id="five"</code>, <code>id="six"</code>, <code>id="seven"</code>, <code>id="eight"</code>, and <code>id="nine"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #3:</strong> My calculator should contain 4 clickable elements each containing one of the 4 primary mathematical operators with the following corresponding IDs: <code>id="add"</code>, <code>id="subtract"</code>, <code>id="multiply"</code>, <code>id="divide"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #4:</strong> My calculator should contain a clickable element containing a <code>.</code> (decimal point) symbol with a corresponding <code>id="decimal"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #5:</strong> My calculator should contain a clickable element with an <code>id="clear"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #6:</strong> My calculator should contain an element to display values with a corresponding <code>id="display"</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #7:</strong> At any time, pressing the <code>clear</code> button clears the input and output values, and returns the calculator to its initialized state; 0 should be shown in the element with the id of <code>display</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #8:</strong> As I input numbers, I should be able to see my input in the element with the id of <code>display</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #9:</strong> In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit <code>=</code>, the correct result should be shown in the element with the id of <code>display</code>.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #10:</strong> When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #11:</strong> When the decimal element is clicked, a <code>.</code> should append to the currently displayed value; two <code>.</code> in one number should not be accepted.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #12:</strong> I should be able to perform any operation (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>) on numbers containing decimal points.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #13:</strong> If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (<code>-</code>) sign). For example, if <code>5 + * 7 =</code> is entered, the result should be <code>35</code> (i.e. <code>5 * 7</code>); if <code>5 * - 5 =</code> is entered, the result should be <code>-25</code> (i.e. <code>5 * (-5)</code>).</p>
<p><strong>User Story #14:</strong> Pressing an operator immediately following <code>=</code> should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>User Story #15:</strong> My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, but you should be able to handle calculations like <code>2 / 7</code> with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).</p>

## What I learned

I learned how to do simple math calculations using functions, conditions and performing actions using keyboard. I also tried styled components for the first time, to achieve theme toggle functionality. It turned out to be an amazing experience and I definitely would love to do some more project suing styled components.
